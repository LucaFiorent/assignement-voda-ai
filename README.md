## Luca Fiorentino

Welcome to Luca Fiorentino! This project is a modern web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It includes the essential setup for a fast and responsive user experience.

### 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### 🛠️ Step 1: Clone the repository

If you haven't already cloned the repository, use the following command to clone it locally:

git clone :link: []()
Then navigate to the project folder:

### :outbox_tray: `cd ./assignement-voda-ai`

### 📦 Step 2: Install dependencies

After you've navigated to the project folder, run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

### :outbox_tray: `npm install`

This will install the dependencies listed in package.json to make sure your project is ready to run.

### 🌐 Step 3: Start the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with:

### :outbox_tray: `npm run dev`

This will start the Vite development server, and you can access your project at:

:link: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

You should see the app running in your browser!

### Design decisions

- The user interface is designed to be visually appealing and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.
- A dark mode was chosen, which can be easily expanded to include a light mode using Tailwind.
- Rounded shapes enhance elegance, while slight animations improve usability.
- An optimistic UI approach is used while fetching data, assuming fast interactions and ensuring a smooth user experience, reducing flickering.
- Additionally, prefetching and caching mechanisms are implemented to minimize reload times.

### Bonus

- Enganging, responsive and creative user interface implemented. Optimistic UI for reduced flickering.

- Implemented chaching, prefetching and pagination thanks to React Query
